# AWS with localstack and Python

AWS is a leading cloud platform offering a vast range of services, providing endless opportunities for innovation and scalability. However, experimenting with these services can be costly. LocalStack allows you to simulate AWS services locally, saving costs during development and testing. Python, with its quick development-centric approach, is ideal for this purpose. This course will use the basics of Python and Docker to help you master AWS services efficiently and cost-effectively.

**Prerequisite: Nothing :) will ensure you understand everything**
## Check System
