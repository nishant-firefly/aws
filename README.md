# AWS with localstack and Python

AWS is a leading cloud platform offering a vast range of services, providing endless opportunities for innovation and scalability. 
However, experimenting with these services can be costly. LocalStack allows you to simulate AWS services locally, saving costs during development and testing. 
Will use Python to test AWS services locally.

**Prerequisite: Nothing :) will ensure you understand everything**
## Check System
```bash 
python check_services.py 
# {'Docker': {'running': True}, 'Localstack': {'running': True}}
```
### Prerequisite

The file `up_system/.env` should be available after running `generate_env.py` as mentioned in [Generate AWS Credentials and Configuration](up_system/README.md#generate-aws-credentials-and-configuration).
